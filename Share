**Configuring Razor Pages root**

The user mentions that their Blazor project has a "Pages" folder within the "Components" folder, which is causing issues with the default structure. They're asking if they can change the fallback for Razor Pages. To help them, I need to guide them on configuring the app to look for a host file in their custom folder structure instead of searching for it at the default root location. I'll explain how to adjust the Razor Pages root and fallback paths as needed.

**Configuring Razor Pages directory**

To solve this, the user can override the default Razor Pages directory structure by setting the `RootDirectory` for Razor Pages. I’d suggest adding this in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddRazorPages(options => {
    options.RootDirectory = "/Components/Pages";
});
```

Then, for fallback, update it to explicitly reference the page’s location like this:

```csharp
app.MapFallbackToPage("/Components/Pages/_Host");
```

This way, the app will recognize the custom folder structure while using the fallback.


Thought for 10 seconds


You absolutely can keep your `.cshtml` files under `Components/Pages` – you just have to tell the Razor-Pages system where to look. By default it only serves files in the `/Pages` folder, so your `_Host.cshtml` was “invisible.” Here are two ways to fix it without moving files:

---

## 1) Reconfigure Razor-Pages’ root directory

In your **Program.cs** (Blazor Server project) do:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using StarTrends.Services;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// 1) Add Razor-Pages, telling it that pages live under /Components/Pages
builder.Services.AddRazorPages(options =>
{
    options.RootDirectory = "/Components/Pages";
});
builder.Services.AddServerSideBlazor();

// 2) Your other services
builder.Services.AddScoped<IOracleDataService, OracleDataService>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IChartGeneratorService, ChartGeneratorService>();

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseStaticFiles();
app.UseRouting();

// 3) Map everything, same as before
app.MapRazorPages();
app.MapBlazorHub();
app.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");

app.Run();
```

With that in place, when you request `/` or any client-side route:

1. ASP NET will look for `/Components/Pages/_Host.cshtml`
2. It finds it, serves it, and bootstraps your `<App>` component
3. Your Blazor router then kicks in and shows whatever page/component has `@page "/"`

---

## 2) Or: map the fallback to the exact physical path

If you’d rather not override the root, you can point the fallback at your custom location:

```csharp
app.MapFallbackToPage("/Components/Pages/_Host");
```

…but I strongly recommend **Option 1**, since it means all your other Razor Pages (if any) will also be found automatically under `Components/Pages`.

---

Once you’ve done **either** of the above, rebuild & run. Hitting `https://localhost:7287/` will serve your `_Host.cshtml` from `Components/Pages`, and your Blazor UI will come up exactly as before.
