**Diagnosing image issue**

The user mentions they're not getting an image even when hitting the endpoint manually. It seems like they might still be using the '/api/graphs/otc-product-types' endpoint, not the correct '/api/graphs/otc-chart'. I need to suggest checking if the endpoints are properly replaced. The 'GraphController.cs' code may need updating: it looks like they haven't yet replaced the old endpoints with the new '/otc-chart' route. I’ll confirm if both the URL and controller code align with the new setup.


Thought for 6 seconds


Let’s drill in and make sure the *same* single endpoint is both regenerating and serving the PNG, and that you’re calling it by the *exact* URL it lives on.

---

## 1) Replace your two‐action controller with one unified action

Open **GraphController.cs** and replace its contents with this:

```csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using StarTrends.Services;

namespace StarTrends.Controllers
{
    [ApiController]
    [Route("api/graphs")]
    public class GraphController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly IGraphService _svc;
        public GraphController(IGraphService svc) => _svc = svc;

        /// <summary>
        /// GET api/graphs/otc-chart?refresh=true
        /// If refresh=true, re‐runs Python. Always returns the PNG.
        /// </summary>
        [HttpGet("otc-chart")]
        public async Task<IActionResult> GetOtcChart([FromQuery] bool refresh = false)
        {
            if (refresh)
            {
                // regen the chart on disk or in memory
                await _svc.RegenerateChartAsync();
            }

            var img = await _svc.GetCachedChartAsync();
            if (img == null || img.Length == 0)
                return NotFound();
            return File(img, "image/png");
        }
    }
}
```

**Key points:**

* There is *only* one endpoint: **`GET /api/graphs/otc-chart`**
* If you append `?refresh=true`, it will call your Python renderer first.
* It then returns the raw PNG bytes with `Content-Type: image/png`.

## 2) Wire your Blazor `<img>` to call that endpoint

In **Shared/ChartViewer.razor**, use this:

```razor
@inject NavigationManager Nav

<div class="chart-container">
  <img src="@_chartUrl" alt="OTC Chart" style="max-width:100%;" />

  <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-primary mt-2" @onclick="RefreshChart">
    ↻ Refresh
  </button>
</div>

@code {
  private string _chartUrl;

  protected override void OnInitialized()
  {
    // initial load (no regen)
    SetChartUrl(refresh: false);
  }

  private void SetChartUrl(bool refresh)
  {
    // build the full URL, with cache‐buster
    var ts = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.ToUnixTimeSeconds();
    _chartUrl = $"{Nav.BaseUri}api/graphs/otc-chart?refresh={refresh}&ts={ts}";
  }

  private Task RefreshChart()
  {
    // switch to refresh + new ts so browser re-fetches
    SetChartUrl(refresh: true);
    return Task.CompletedTask;
  }
}
```

---

## 3) Test it step by step

1. **Rebuild** and **run** your app.
2. In your browser’s address bar, request:

   ```
   https://localhost:7287/api/graphs/otc-chart
   ```

   You should see the PNG (even if stale).
3. Now hit:

   ```
   https://localhost:7287/api/graphs/otc-chart?refresh=true
   ```

   —this should trigger your Python renderer and return the *new* PNG immediately.

Once those two URLs both return a valid image, your Blazor `<img>` will start showing it on page‐load and on “Refresh” clicks.

---

### If you still get **404** or an empty response:

* **Double‐check** that you have **`builder.Services.AddControllers()`** and **`app.MapControllers()`** in `Program.cs`, *before* your Blazor endpoints.
* Make sure you’re calling **`/api/graphs/otc-chart`** exactly (no typos).
* Use your browser’s *Network* tab or a tool like `curl -v` to inspect the raw response—status code, content‐type, response body size.

With this single‐endpoint pattern in place, you’ll have 100% control over regeneration and delivery of the chart. Let me know what you see when you hit `/api/graphs/otc-chart?refresh=true` directly!
