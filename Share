Backend-generated charts
Instead of shipping heavy Plotly libraries to the browser, we now generate every graph on the server. Under the hood, each chart pulls data via OracleDataService, writes it out to a CSV, runs a simple Matplotlib script in Python, and saves the result as a PNG in /wwwroot/charts. Our Blazor <GraphBox> component then just displays that image—so pages load instantly, no bulky JavaScript required.
Automatic updatesWe’ve wired up a background worker (ChartUpdaterWorker) to regenerate all charts on a schedule (hourly, nightly, etc.). Each step is wrapped in try/catch, errors are logged, and a “Last Updated” timestamp is recorded. This ensures our site remains highly reliable and fast, always showing fresh data without manual intervention.
