To integrate your Plotly.js library (from a local ZIP/folder) into a Blazor Server project (since you can’t use NuGet for this), follow these steps:


---

Step 1: Extract Plotly Folder

Extract the Plotly.js ZIP to a known folder. Let's say:
wwwroot/js/plotly


The main JS file should be:
wwwroot/js/plotly/plotly.js
(or possibly plotly.min.js)


---

Step 2: Reference Plotly in _Host.cshtml

Open:
Pages/_Host.cshtml
(Blazor Server) and add this before </body>:

<script src="~/js/plotly/plotly.min.js"></script>

Or if you're using the full version:

<script src="~/js/plotly/plotly.js"></script>


---

Step 3: Create a JS interop file (optional but clean)

Create a new file:
wwwroot/js/plotlyInterop.js

Example content:

window.plotlyInterop = {
    drawChart: function (elementId, data, layout) {
        Plotly.newPlot(elementId, data, layout);
    }
};

Then include it in _Host.cshtml as well:

<script src="~/js/plotlyInterop.js"></script>


---

Step 4: Call from Blazor

In your Blazor component (e.g. Pages/Chart.razor):

@inject IJSRuntime JSRuntime

<div id="myPlot" style="width:100%;height:400px;"></div>

@code {
    protected override async Task OnAfterRenderAsync(bool firstRender)
    {
        if (firstRender)
        {
            var data = new[]
            {
                new {
                    x = new[] { "A", "B", "C" },
                    y = new[] { 10, 15, 13 },
                    type = "bar"
                }
            };

            var layout = new {
                title = "My Plotly Chart"
            };

            await JSRuntime.InvokeVoidAsync("plotlyInterop.drawChart", "myPlot", data, layout);
        }
    }
}


---

Summary:

Put Plotly files under wwwroot/js/plotly

Reference them in _Host.cshtml

Use JavaScript interop to call Plotly from Blazor


Let me know if your folder contains other Plotly files or a different structure, and I’ll adjust the paths for you.
